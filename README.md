# Apromore Core

This repository contains source code of the [Apromore](https://apromore.org) Core process analytics web application server.  It can be built and run on its own, or used as a submodule containing components common to the two other Apromore editions:

* [Apromore Community Edition](https://github.com/apromore/ApromoreCE), which is open source.
* [Apromore Enterprise Edition](https://github.com/apromore/ApromoreEE), which is proprietary.

The instructions below are for the installation of Apromore Core from the source code. For convenience, we also make available a containerized image in [Docker](https://github.com/apromore/ApromoreDocker).
If you are looking for the commercial edition (Apromore Enterprise Edition), check the [Apromore web site](https://apromore.org/)

## System requirements
* Linux Ubuntu 20.04 (We do not support newer versions as it may lead to dependency issues), Windows 10/WS2016/WS2019, Mac OSX 10.8 or newer.
* Java SE 11 ["Server JRE"](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) or
  ["JDK 11"](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) . For Ubuntu, it can be installed as `sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk`
  Note that newer versions, including Java SE 11, are currently not supported
* [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) 3.5.2 or newer, and internet access for it to download this project's dependencies.
* [Lessc](http://lesscss.org/usage/) 3.9.0 or newer
* (optional) [MySQL server](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/) 8.0.
* <b>Note:</b> These instructions are tested with Linux Ubuntu 20.04. With minor adaptations, these instructions may be used for Windows 10/WS20016/WS2019 and macOS 10.8 or newer.

## Installation Instructions

* Check out the source code using git: `git clone https://github.com/apromore/ApromoreCore.git`
* Switch to the ApromoreCore directory: `cd ApromoreCore`
* Check out the desired branch or tag: `git checkout development`
* Execute `mvn clean install` to compile the source code into executable bundles.
* Execute `core-assemblies/apromore-core/target/assembly/bin/karaf` to start the server.
  <b>Note:</b> If you deploy to port 80 (or another port below 1024), you will need to run the previous command as sudo.
* Browse [(http://localhost:8181/)](http://localhost:8181/). Login as an administrator by using the following credentials: username - "admin" and password - "password". You can also create a new account. Once logged in, a user can change their password via `Account -> Change password` menu.
* Keep the prompt/terminal window open. Ctrl-D on the window will shut the server down.


## Configuration
The following configuration options apply to all editions of Apromore.
When there are additional configurations specific to a particular edition, they are documented in that edition's own README file.

Almost all configuration occurs in the `site.properties` file which is located in the `ApromoreCore` directory.
The default version of this file from a fresh git checkout contains reasonable defaults that allow the server to be started without any manual configuration.


### MySQL setup
By default, Apromore Core uses MySQL database. For casual evaluation, Apromore can also be used with H2.

* Ensure MySQL is configured to accept local TCP connections on port 3306 in its .cnf file; "skip-networking" should not be present.

* Create a database named 'apromore' in your MySQL server. Also create 2 user accounts which use the Apromore application.
* You will be prompted to enter the root password of MySQL

```bash
mysql -u root -p
CREATE DATABASE apromore CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci;

CREATE USER 'apromore'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'MAcri';
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, LOCK TABLES, EXECUTE, SHOW VIEW ON apromore.* TO 'apromore'@'localhost';

CREATE USER 'liquibase_user'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '7fHJV41fpJ';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON apromore.* TO 'liquibase_user'@'%';
	
```

* Rebuild the server using `mvn clean install -pl :apromore-core`, or simply copy the edited `site.properties` to `core-assemblies/apromore-core/target/assembly/etc/site.cfg`.
* Identically to the default MySQL database, the H2 database will have one user: "admin".
* To use H2, edit the top-level `site.properties` file, replacing the MySQL declarations in "Database and JPA" with the commented-out H2 properties.


### Heap size
Memory limits are set using the usual JVM parameters.

The startup options must be set in the `JAVA_OPTS` environment variable.

On Windows:

```dos
set "JAVA_OPTS= -server -Xms20g -Xmx20g"
core-assemblies\apromore-core\target\assembly\bin\karaf.bat clean
```

On unix-style systems:

```bash
export JAVA_OPTS="-server -Xms20g -Xmx20g"
core-assemblies/apromore-core/target/assembly/bin/karaf clean
```


### Cache size
Apromore uses [Ehcache](https://www.ehcache.org/) for internal caching, which uses an XML configuration file.
The default in a deployed server is that the `ehcache.xml` configuration file is located at `core-assemblies/apromore-core/target/assembly/etc/ehcache.xml`.
The manager.ehcache.config.url property in site.properties can be used to point to an `ehcache.xml` at a URL of your choice.


### Backup and restore
Apromore stores its data objects in two places:
* Database: all data, except the event logs
* Event logs which are by default located in the top-level `Event-Logs-Repository` directory

As such, both need to be backed up and restored.
* To backup a H2 database, it is enough to copy across the `Manager-Repository.h2.db` file
* To backup a MySQL database, the following command may be used  (If prompted for password, enter the password of the ‘apromore’ user i.e ‘MAcri’):
```bash
mysqldump -u root -p apromore > backup.sql
```

To backup only one table (rather than the whole database), the following command may be used:
```bash
mysqldump -u -p apromore tablename > tablename.sql
```

To restore, use
```bash
mysql --max_allowed_packet=1G --user=root -p -h localhost apromore < backup.sql
```

* For the event logs directory, it is recommended to zip the directory before copying it across


### LDAP setup

As distributed, Apromore maintains its own catalogue of users and passwords.
It can be configured to instead allow login based on an external LDAP directory.

* Edit the portal Spring configuration in `core-assemblies/apromore-core/target/assembly/etc/configuration/portalContext-security.xml`, uncommenting the jaasAuthenticationProvider as so:

```xml
    <!-- The remote authentication details -->
    <authentication-manager id="authenticationManager">
        <authentication-provider ref="jaasAuthenticationProvider"/>
        <authentication-provider ref="remoteAuthenticationProvider"/>
        <authentication-provider ref="rememberMeAuthenticationProvider"/>
    </authentication-manager>

    <!-- Uncommenting this bean and adding it to #authenticationManager (above) will enable LDAP logins.
         See https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/3.1.x/reference/jaas.html -->
    <beans:bean id="jaasAuthenticationProvider" class="org.springframework.security.authentication.jaas.JaasAuthenticationProvider">
        <beans:property name="loginConfig" value="file:etc/login.conf"/>
        <beans:property name="loginContextName" value="apromore"/>
        <beans:property name="callbackHandlers">
            <beans:list>
                <beans:bean class="org.springframework.security.authentication.jaas.JaasNameCallbackHandler"/>
                <beans:bean class="org.springframework.security.authentication.jaas.JaasPasswordCallbackHandler"/>
            </beans:list>
        </beans:property>
        <beans:property name="authorityGranters">
            <beans:list>
                <beans:bean class="org.apromore.security.AuthorityGranterImpl">
                    <beans:property name="principalClassName" value="com.sun.security.auth.UserPrincipal"/>
                    <beans:property name="grants">
                        <beans:set>
                            <beans:value>ROLE_USER</beans:value>
                        </beans:set>
                    </beans:property>
                </beans:bean>
            </beans:list>
        </beans:property>
    </beans:bean>
```

* Edit `core-assemblies/apromore-core/target/assembly/etc/site.cfg` (section marked "LDAP")
* Create `core-assemblies/apromore-core/target/assembly/etc/login.conf` to match your local LDAP installation.
  You could place it at another location by changing the loginConfig property from the previous step.
  As an example, the UoM version looks like this:
  ```
  apromore {
      com.sun.security.auth.module.LdapLoginModule REQUIRED
              userProvider="ldaps://centaur.unimelb.edu.au"
              authIdentity="uid={USERNAME},ou=people,o=unimelb";
  };
  ```

When the server starts with the reconfigured portal, it will automatically create new accounts for valid LDAP logins.


## Change Port Number (optional)
* Change the default port number by changing the value of `site.port` variable in the `site.cfg` file and the `org.osgi.service.http.port` variable in the `org.ops4j.pax.web.cfg` file, both present in the `core-assemblies/apromore-core/target/assembly/etc` directory.

### Share file to all users (optional)

* By default Apromore does not allow you to share a file with all users (i.e. the "public" group is not supported by default). You can change this by editing the site.cfg file present in the `core-assemblies/apromore-core/target/assembly/etc` directory. Specifically, to enable the option to share files and folders with the “public” group, you should set `security.publish.enable = true` in the site.cfg file.


## Common problems

> Out of memory while building.

* Either invoke `mvn` as `mvn -Xmx1G -XX:MaxPermSize=256m` or set the system property `MAVEN_OPTS` to `-Xmx1G -XX:MaxPermSize=256m`

> Server fails to start.

* If Apromore is configured to use MySQL, confirm that the database server is running.
* If you already run another server (e.g. OS X Server) you may need to change the port number.

> Web pages are illegible.

* Double-check that `lessc` is correctly installed.  Confirm that `mvn clean install -pl :ui-theme-compact` reports no errors.

> Can't view models by clicking them in the summary list.

* Model diagrams are opened in new tabs/windows; you may need to disable popup blocking for Apromore in your browser settings.

> Where is the server log?

* `core-assemblies/apromore-core/target/assembly/data/log/karaf.log`
